##### User Perspective:

- Laptop-Valley is a Tech-based product seller website. We are providing our customers with the best quality laptops at the most reasonable price.

- Users can log in through registration or google singing, place an order, cancel an order before order confirmation, and also review our product.


#### Admin Perspective:
- Our website also provides an admin panel. The admin role is to add, delete, update and  approve userâ€™s orders and also can add a new admin.

- an admin logs in, he/she will not see the options that a normal user sees. Instead an admin will see Manage All Orders, Add A Product, Make Admin, Manage Products Logout. Based on your website idea, you can change the name of these menu items. Details about Manage all orders or Manage products will be provided later.
